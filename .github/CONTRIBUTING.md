## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/VeriQAi/GradeBridge-Student-Submission/issues) to avoid duplicates.

### How to Submit a Bug Report

1. Use the [bug report template](https://github.com/VeriQAi/GradeBridge-Student-Submission/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
2. Provide a clear, descriptive title
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. Describe what you expected to happen vs. what actually happened
5. Include browser information and screenshots if possible

   - **Client-side processing** (no server dependencies)
   - **Privacy-first** (data stays on student's device)
   - **Gradescope compatibility**
   - **Student-friendly** (simple, intuitive interface)
   - **Educator-approved** (supports academic integrity)

### How to Submit a Feature Request

## Contributing Code

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- A modern code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of React and TypeScript

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GradeBridge-Student-Submission.git
   cd GradeBridge-Student-Submission
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

4. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed

5. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   npm run dev      # Test in development mode
   npm run build    # Ensure it builds
   npm run preview  # Test the production build
   ```

6. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

   Use clear, concise commit messages:
   - `Add feature: LaTeX equation editor`
   - `Fix: PDF generation with large images`
   - `Update: README installation instructions`

7. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then open a PR on GitHub using our [PR template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

### Development Workflow

- **Keep PRs focused**: One feature or fix per PR
- **Update from main regularly**: Rebase or merge to stay current
- **Test thoroughly**: Include test cases if possible
- **Document changes**: Update README or add inline comments
- **Be responsive**: Address review feedback promptly

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React

- Use **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- Write **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React best practices**:
  - Use descriptive component and variable names
  - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
  - Keep components small and focused
  - Avoid prop drilling (use context when appropriate)

### Code Formatting

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **single quotes** for strings
- Add **trailing commas** in multi-line arrays/objects
- Use **const** by default, **let** only when reassignment is needed
- Avoid **any** types - use proper TypeScript types

Example:
```typescript
// Good
const [studentName, setStudentName] = useState<string>('');

interface ProblemProps {
  problem: Problem;
  onSubmit: (data: SubmissionData) => void;
}

export const ProblemRenderer: React.FC<ProblemProps> = ({ problem, onSubmit }) => {
  // Component logic
};

// Avoid
var name = '';  // Use const/let
const handleSubmit = (data: any) => {};  // Use proper types
```

### File Organization

- **Components**: One component per file
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Location**: Place files in appropriate directories (components/, services/, types/)

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code with clear names
- Add comments for:
  - Complex algorithms or business logic
  - Browser-specific workarounds
  - Educational context (why certain approaches are used)
  - Security or privacy considerations

```typescript
// Good: Explains why, not what
// Auto-save debounced to prevent excessive localStorage writes
// which can cause performance issues on older devices
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    saveToLocalStorage(data);
  }, 1000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [data]);
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR, test:

1. **Core Workflows**
   - Load an assignment JSON
   - Enter student information
   - Complete different problem types (text, image, AI reflective)
   - Generate PDF
   - Export/import backup JSON

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Large images (5MB+)
   - Many problems (20+)
   - Long text answers with LaTeX
   - Browser refresh (auto-save recovery)

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Test on both desktop and tablet if possible

4. **Privacy/Security**
   - Verify no data is sent to external servers (check Network tab)
   - Test localStorage persistence
   - Ensure exported files contain expected data

### Automated Testing

While we don't currently have a comprehensive test suite, contributions of tests are welcome:

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for key workflows
- Accessibility tests

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and components
- Document complex types and interfaces
- Include examples for non-obvious usage

```typescript
/**
 * Renders a problem with its statement and submission widget
 * @param problem - The problem configuration from assignment JSON
 * @param submissionData - Current student answers for this problem
 * @param onSubmit - Callback when student updates their answer
 */
export const ProblemRenderer: React.FC<ProblemProps> = ({ ... }) => {
  // ...
};
```

### User Documentation

If your change affects how students use the app:

- Update the README.md
- Add examples or screenshots
- Consider creating a brief guide in comments
- Mention it in your PR description

## Privacy and Educational Context

### Privacy Requirements

All contributions **must maintain**:

- **Client-side processing**: No data sent to servers
- **LocalStorage only**: No cookies, tracking, or analytics
- **Export control**: Students can backup and delete their data
- **No external dependencies** that compromise privacy

### Educational Considerations

Remember that this tool is used in academic settings:

- **Maintain academic integrity**: No features that facilitate cheating
- **Accessibility**: Consider students with disabilities
- **Reliability**: Students depend on this for graded work
- **Simplicity**: Students need to focus on content, not the tool
- **Cross-platform**: Works on school computers, personal devices, etc.
